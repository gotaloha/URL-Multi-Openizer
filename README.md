# URL Multi-Openizer

This is a Chrome extension created on a whim based upon a shower thought from a friend. "Wouldn't it be neat if you could have a list of URLs that open all at once and can be saved and shared with others?"

Yep! That would be neat. So I made this thing.

# Installation
1. Fork, clone, or download this repository into an empty folder of your choosing.

_To install, you must first enable "Developer Mode" within Chrome's Extension manager._

2. Navigate to this URL: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable the **Developer Mode** toggle switch in the upper-right corner of the page
4. Simply **drag the folder** containing this repo's files onto the page.
5. The extension should now be installed and active!

Navigate to any Reddit post to verify.

Please note that I make no guarantees that this will continue functioning in perpetuity. Since this was born out of my own need, I will likely fix any breaking changes as quickly as possible.
